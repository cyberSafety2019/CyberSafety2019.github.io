						<p name="keynote_tyler_abstract" id="keynote_tyler_abstract">
							 <b>Abstract</b>: Redditâ€™s moderation and governance model is unique within the internet landscape. In addition to its sitewide policies and enforcement, Reddit has cultivated a community-driven ecosystem that empowers users to work with volunteer community moderators and internal company admins to help curate quality content and reduce the exposure of rule-breaking content and ensure the content is fitting with community standards. Increasingly, Reddit is using data science to aggregate and enrich these signals, allowing us to catch issues that would be more challenging for an individual to notice. This investment in data science has drastically improved the speed and efficacy with which Reddit is able to respond to threats. By better leveraging analytics, Reddit has been able to increase the percentage of content that is taken down proactively from 27% in 2017 to around 99%.

							<b>Bio</b>:  Tyler Otto is the Director of Threat Analytics at Reddit. His team leverages data science for the detection and mitigation of scaled threats targeting Reddit. This includes things like spam, vote manipulation, site integrity, and malicious bots. Additionally, his team builds models to help improve traditional operations teams be more effective and efficient. Prior to running threat analytics at Reddit, Tyler lead the product Data Science team at Reddit. Before Reddit, he was the Head of Data Science at Hipmunk, a travel startup that was acquired by Concur.
