						 <b>Abstract</b>: Redditâ€™s moderation and governance model is unique within the internet landscape. In addition to its sitewide policies and enforcement, Reddit has cultivated a community-driven ecosystem that empowers users to work with volunteer community moderators and internal company admins to help curate quality content and reduce the exposure of rule-breaking content and ensure the content is fitting with community standards. Increasingly, Reddit is using data science to aggregate and enrich these signals, allowing us to catch issues that would be more challenging for an individual to notice. This investment in data science has drastically improved the speed and efficacy with which Reddit is able to respond to threats. By better leveraging analytics, Reddit has been able to increase the percentage of content that is taken down proactively from 27% in 2017 to around 99%.
